# Few scripts to explore the tf ecosystems

This set of scirpts allow to explore:
* Tensorflow Data Validation
* Tensorflow Transform
* Estimator in TensorFlow

The section about TensorFlow Model Analyis currently is not working
due to the partial support in python3.

The code can be run within a `virtualenv` in python3 by installing
the packages in requirement.txt.

As an alternative one can use AI Platform Notebook either on GCP
or [locally](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-deep-learning-containers-consistent-and-portable-environments).

Follow the order of the directory (by skipping 06_tmfa), adapt the
bash scripts, run them and then check the notebook.
